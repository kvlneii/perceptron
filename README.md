# Perceptron Iris Classification
This project implements a Perceptron model to classify iris flowers into two categories: "Iris-setosa" and "Iris-virginica." 

### The program is designed to accomplish the following objectives:
1)  **Training**: The Perceptron is trained using a user-provided training dataset in CSV format. It dynamically adapts to any number of attributes, making it versatile for various datasets.
2)  **Evaluation**: The program assesses the accuracy of the Perceptron on a separate test dataset (also in CSV format). It calculates the percentage of correctly classified flowers both overall and for each species.
3)  **Interactive Classification**: An interactive interface is provided, allowing users to input individual flower attributes for real-time classification.

### Dataset
This project relies on two CSV datasets for training and testing. The datasets should adhere to the following format:
* Each row represents an iris flower.
* The last column contains the species label ("Iris-setosa" or "Iris-virginica").
* The preceding columns contain numerical attributes (features) of the iris flower.
